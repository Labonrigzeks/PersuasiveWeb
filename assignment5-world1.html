                <p class="cause-crash-text">There has been a cause of relentless amount of speculations on social media, as for the cause of the plane crash. 
                The truth is, the plane was shot down unintentionally by our missiles, our operator had mistaken the plane for a cruise missile. 
                We lied to society, by saying the plane suffered techincal problems shortly after take-off, as we thought it would stir more problem around the society. 
                We believe, our decision was right, to come out with the truth at a later date.</p>

            <p class="statement-text">Our President is deeply sorry for the downing of the plane. 
                Because of the threats that were occurring at the time and the potential chance of the Americans attacking, the Iranian armed forces were ready to step up in the case of an attack by the Americans. 
                Unfortunately, because of human error, by believing that there were American attack inbound, the rocket was fired which hit the target we thought was an "cruise missile". The government apologizes deeply.</p>
